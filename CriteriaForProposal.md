Things to do: 
- Clarify project description (needs more details?)- How does this fit into other ESIP testbed work? (Don't know...) 
- Make sure the "Ultimate Benefit" isn't buried in text (Make new section specifically for this - even if just a few sentences)
- Create timeline
- Where will use cases come from? (Is it enough to say - we'll solicit from the ESIP community?)- Create a budget (Why are we asking for money?)
- Can we use $ for APC of an open access publication? (Earth Science Informatics costs ~ $3k... PLoS One costs ~$2k ... PeerJ - much more affordable, not may be out of scope.
