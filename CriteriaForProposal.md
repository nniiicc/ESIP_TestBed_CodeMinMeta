**Criteria for Proposal**

Things to do: 
- Clarify project description (needs more details?)- How does this fit into other ESIP testbed work? (Don't know...) 
- Make sure the "Ultimate Benefit" isn't buried in text (Make new section specifically for this - even if just a few sentences)
- Create timeline
- Where will use cases come from? (Is it enough to say - we'll solicit from the ESIP community?)- Create a budget (Why are we asking for money?)
- Can we use $ for APC of an open access publication? (Earth Science Informatics costs ~ $3k... PLoS One costs ~$2k ... PeerJ - much more affordable, not may be out of scope.

We spent first half of the meeting brainstorming on a testbed proposal that can be found here:

IDEAS for winter meeting

Our general idea is to build upon the recommendations from the summer meeting

Examples of potential ways to incentivize software contribution (i.e. badges) , Award for best software effort, etc. 


The session might work as follows: 

- Begin with overview of recommendations ( Bob Downs volunteered to do this)
- Assign people to lead small discussion on most promising areas (3-4)
- Criteria for selection should be easy / low hanging fruit 

To do: Nic revise the session on the commons and email group the recommendations from WSSSPE paper.

Categories from WSSSPE paper: 

- Collaboration
- Publications and Presentations
- Workshops, training and best practices
- Develop and document best practices
- Incentives and motivations
- Reviewed software repository

A Policy statement on Software for Earth Science Research: 

Inspired by http://www.change.org/p/everyone-in-the-research-community-we-must-accept-that-software-is-fundamental-to-research-or-we-will-lose-our-ability-to-make-groundbreaking-discoveries

ESIP has done policy statement related to data access and citations - so should ESIP take this on - should this group be responsible for writing that statement - or driving the writing of this statement? 

Software cluster agreed that a potential next step for ESIP is to draft and distribute to partners a statement about importance of sustaining research software. 

Nic recommends working with //www.isi.edu/ikcap/geosoft/ group if we decide to do this.

For next meeting: 

- Review WSSSPE
- Further discuss the policy statement, and assign tasks for winter meeting.
